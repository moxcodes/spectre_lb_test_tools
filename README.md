# Tools and scripts for working with load-balancing in spectre

A collection of tools for analyzing the data provided by Charm++ projections
along with extra data inserted into the stream by the SpECTRE load-balancing
monitoring system for analyzing and visualizing the efficacy of load-balancing
attempts.
This also includes more general spectre script utilities, like a simple (ugly)
yaml preprocessor for automating several runs of varied parameters.
